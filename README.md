# Steps needed

The user should save the 2 folders in the same folder. 

The user should open 2 different terminals, one for the server and one for the client.

The user, iniatially, should run the command ```npm i``` in the 2 terminals in order all the needed libraries, frameworks, etc to be installed. With this way the user will not face error throught the runtime. 

The user after all the previous steps, can now run the application by typying ```npm start``` in the 2 different terminals.
