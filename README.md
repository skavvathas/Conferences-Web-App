In each terminals should type the 2 following commands: ```npm i``` in order all the node_modules to be installed and ```npm start``` in order the client and the server to begin building.

Really Important notice

The user need to add a file with name : ```.env``` in the server folder. A .env file in a React project is used to store environment variables, providing a way 
to configure and manage settings such as API keys or server URLs.
